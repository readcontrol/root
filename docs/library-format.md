# Library Format Specification

**Version:** `1`  
**Status:** implemented — the contract the shipped components (`core`, `extension`, `macos`) conform to.

This document is the **shared contract** between all ReadControl components. Every component that
reads or writes library files must conform to it. Treat breaking changes as a major version bump;
announce them in all three repos.

## Folder layout

```
<library-root>/
  articles/
    <prefix>/                 # first 2 chars of the id — a fan-out bucket
      <id>/                   # one self-contained folder per reading
        article.md            # the reading (Markdown + YAML frontmatter)
        assets/
          <sha256>.<ext>      # captured image, linked as assets/<file>
        highlights.md         # optional — the reading's saved highlights (§ Highlights)
        position.md           # optional — where the user stopped reading (§ Reading position)
        original.html         # optional — raw HTML snapshot for future re-processing
```

- `<library-root>` is the folder the user chooses (Dropbox, iCloud Drive, Google Drive, etc.).
- Each reading is one folder named by its id (see § ID scheme), under a two-character fan-out
  bucket so no directory grows unbounded. Everything for the reading lives inside it, so moving or
  deleting a reading is a single folder operation.
- The per-device SQLite index lives **outside** this folder (e.g.
  `~/Library/Application Support/ReadControl/`) and is **never synced**.
- Paths stored in the database must be **relative to the library root** — never absolute.

## Article file (`articles/<prefix>/<id>/article.md`)

Each saved reading is a single UTF-8 Markdown file named `article.md` inside the reading's folder,
with YAML frontmatter.

### Frontmatter schema

---
```

#### Required fields
`format_version`, `id`, `url`, `canonical_url`, `title`, `saved_at`, `archived`, `favorite`,
`rating`, `tags`, `source_hash`.

#### Optional fields
`author`, `site`, `read_at`, `excerpt`, `word_count`, `lang`.

#### Rules
- `saved_at` is set once at save time and **never updated**, even when metadata is edited.
- **Read state is the presence of `read_at`**: a timestamp means read (its value is when it was
  last marked read); an absent field means unread. There is no separate `read` boolean.
- `archived`, `favorite`, and `rating` are the source of truth for those states — the DB mirrors them.
- `tags` elements must be lowercase, trimmed, and contain no spaces (use `-` as separator).
- `source_hash` is recomputed on any edit to the body; the DB uses it to detect stale index entries.

### Body

The article body follows immediately after the closing `---` of the frontmatter, separated by a
blank line. It is **Markdown** (CommonMark), cleaned of navigation, ads, banners, and popups.

- The body carries **no top-level `#` heading**: the frontmatter `title` is the reading's single
  title, which the reader renders as the sole h1. The extension demotes any `#` the source used to
  `##`, so body headings start at `##`.
- Image references use **relative paths** into the reading's own `assets/` folder: `assets/<file>`
  (the article file and its `assets/` folder are siblings), e.g. `![alt](assets/3f4a1b.jpg)`.
- Do not embed images as base64.

## Asset files (`articles/<prefix>/<id>/assets/<sha256>.<ext>`)

- Each reading's images live in an `assets/` sub-folder inside the reading's own folder, beside
  `article.md`, and are linked from the body as `assets/<file>`.
- Filename is the **lowercase hex SHA-256** of the file's raw bytes, with an extension chosen from
  the image's `Content-Type` (falling back to the URL): e.g. `3f4a1b8e....jpg`.
- Images are **captured by the browser extension** (from the page's cache where possible) and sent
  to the host, which only writes them — the host performs no network requests. An image the
  extension couldn't capture is left as a remote URL in the Markdown and is never re-fetched; the
  reader shows a labelled placeholder for it.
- The original HTML snapshot is optional. If kept, it lives as `original.html` inside the reading's
  folder for future re-processing.

---

## Highlights (`articles/<prefix>/<id>/highlights.md`)

A reading's saved highlights live in `highlights.md` inside the reading's folder — one file per
reading, absent when the reading has none. Each highlight is the verbatim selected text as a
Markdown block quote, ended by an HTML comment carrying a stable id:

```markdown
> The exact text the user highlighted.
<!-- hl 01J9Z8X7Q2VBKN3P4HXYZ01AB -->
```

The scanner keys on the fixed `article.md` name, so a reading's `highlights.md` (and its `assets/`)
are never mistaken for readings.

---

## Reading position (`articles/<prefix>/<id>/position.md`)

Where the user stopped in a reading lives in `position.md` inside the reading's folder — one file
per reading, absent when the reading has no position. The file holds one record: the anchor quote as
a Markdown block quote, then an HTML comment carrying the fields:

```markdown
> The first line of the paragraph where the user stopped.
<!-- pos block=42 percent=0.63 at=2026-08-18T10:12:04.881Z -->
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `block` | integer, 0-based | Index of the **anchor**: a top-level block of the body Markdown. |
| `percent` | float, `0.0`–`1.0` | Progress before the anchor block. |
| `at` | ISO-8601 UTC | When the position last changed; same format as `saved_at`. Informational. |
| quote line | text | The start of the anchor block, on one line, at most 120 characters. |

#### Rules

- **Count blocks in the body Markdown source**, before any transform a client applies to render it.
  Every client then arrives at the same index.
- `percent` is the number of body characters before the anchor block divided by the number of body
  characters in total, measured on the Markdown source — so every client computes the same value.
- The quote keeps the file readable, and lets a client find the anchor again when the body changed.
  Runs of whitespace collapse to a single space, so the quote is always one line.
- **An absent file means "no position".** A damaged file also means "no position", and must never
  stop a scan. A file is damaged when `block`, `percent`, or `at` is missing or unparsable, or when
  the comment has no closing `-->` (which is how a half-synced file looks).
- An **unknown field is ignored**, so a later version can add fields.
- **Block 0 is the start of the article, which is the same as no position**: a writer deletes the
  file rather than storing it. Marking a reading unread deletes it too.

To restore a position, a client resolves in this order: the block index (checking that the quote
agrees), then the quote found elsewhere in the body, then `percent`, and finally the start of the
article.

The scanner keys on the fixed `article.md` name, so `position.md` is never mistaken for a reading.
An index may cache `percent` for the reading list, but the file remains the source of truth: a
rebuild restores every position from the files.

This file is an **addition**: `format_version` stays `1`, and a reader that does not know the file
must ignore it.

---

## ID scheme

A **reading id** is **content-addressed**: the lowercase-hex SHA-256 of the reading's normalized
source URL (see § URL normalization & identity).

- 64 hex characters, e.g. `1146c9a93631d1991af3252dbc49ecd8043ab354a4386e397d555d1ca21a7199`.
- **Deterministic** — the same URL always yields the same id, so the id doubles as the dedup key: to
  check whether a page is already saved, hash its URL and stat the folder it would live in
  (`articles/<prefix>/<id>/`), with no scan and no index.
- The id is the **reading-folder name** (under its `<prefix>` bucket) and the frontmatter `id`
  field. They must match — a folder whose name disagrees with its `article.md`'s `id` is ignored.
- Not time-sortable: the reading list orders by `saved_at` via the index, not by id.

Highlight ids (the `<!-- hl ... -->` markers) are **ULIDs** — 26-character Crockford Base32,
sortable by creation time — because a highlight is identified by when it was made, not by content.

---

## URL normalization & identity

A reading's identity is the **normalized visited URL**: the host normalizes the `url` and the
reading id is its SHA-256 (§ ID scheme). Apply these rules in order:

1. Lowercase the scheme and host.
2. Strip a leading `www.` from the host.
3. Remove the default port (`:80` for http, `:443` for https).
4. Strip the fragment (`#...`).
5. Strip tracking query parameters: `utm_*` (prefix), `fbclid`, `gclid`, `mc_cid`, `mc_eid`, `ref`,
   `source`, `campaign` (exact match).
6. Sort the remaining query parameters — they may be meaningful (pagination, article ids), so keep
   them, but sort so their order can't produce two ids for one page.
7. Remove a trailing `/` from the path **unless** the path is just `/`.

The original `url` (pre-normalization) is always preserved. `canonical_url` stores the page's own
`<link rel="canonical">`/`og:url` when known, for reference — it is **not** the identity key. (So
two different normalized URLs for the same content can produce two readings — an accepted trade-off
of address-bar-only capture.)

## Smart-view semantics

The macOS app's sidebar views are defined by frontmatter field values:

| View | Filter |
|------|--------|
| **All** | `archived == false` |
| **Unread** | `archived == false AND read_at is absent` |
| **Archive** | `archived == true` |
| **Favorites** | `favorite == true` (regardless of archived) |

---

## Format versioning

- `format_version` starts at `1`.
- **Additive changes** (new optional frontmatter fields, new asset conventions, a new optional file
  in a reading folder such as `position.md`) are backwards compatible — do not bump the version. A
  reader that does not know such a file must ignore it, and must leave it in place rather than
  delete or rewrite it.
- **Breaking changes** (renamed/removed required fields, changed semantics) bump the integer.
- Readers must reject files with a `format_version` higher than the version they support, rather
  than silently misread them.
- All three repos (`core`, `extension`, `macos`) must be
  updated in lockstep on a version bump.

## What lives in the library vs. outside it

| Belongs in library (synced) | Belongs outside library (per-device, never synced) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `articles/<prefix>/<id>/article.md` | SQLite index (`~/Library/Application Support/ReadControl/`) |
| `articles/<prefix>/<id>/assets/*` | App preferences (theme, font, library path) |
| `articles/<prefix>/<id>/highlights.md` | Native messaging host manifest |
| `articles/<prefix>/<id>/position.md` | |
| `articles/<prefix>/<id>/original.html` (optional) | |
